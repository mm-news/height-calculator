# HEIGHT CALCULATOR

A simple height calculator that uses trigonometry to calculate the height of an object from shadows.

## How does it work?

![A simplized example](./example.png)

$$ (x+d) *\tan \theta_1 = h = x* \tan \theta_ 2 $$
$$ â‡’ h = (d * \tan^2 \theta_ 1)/(\tan \theta_ 2 - \tan \theta_ 1) $$
