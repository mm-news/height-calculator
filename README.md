# HEIGHT CALCULATOR

A simple height calculator that uses trigonometry to calculate the height of an object from shadows.

## How does it work?

![A simplized example](./example.png)

$$ (x+d) *\tan \theta _{1} = h = x* \tan \theta _{2} $$

$$ â‡’ h = (d * \tan^2 \theta _{1})/(\tan \theta _{2} - \tan \theta _{1}) $$
